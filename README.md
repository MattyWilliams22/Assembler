# AArch64 Emulator and Assembler

This project is a group effort from the summer term of our first year at university. It includes an emulator and assembler for AArch64 binaries, along with an extension: a Snake game that employs various pathfinding algorithms.

## Features

- **Emulator**: Simulates the execution of AArch64 assembly instructions.
- **Assembler**: Converts human-readable AArch64 assembly code into machine-readable binary.
- **Extension**: A Snake game featuring multiple pathfinding algorithms.

## Repository Structure

- **`src/`**: Source code for the emulator and assembler.
- **`extension/`**: Code for the Snake game extension.
- **`doc/`**: Documentation and design notes.
- **`programs/`**: Sample assembly programs to test the emulator.

## Technologies Used

- **C**: Core programming language for emulator and assembler.
- **Assembly**: AArch64 assembly code.
- **Makefile**: Build automation.
