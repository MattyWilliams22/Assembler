\subsection*{Task Allocation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Kritik Pant: Memory initialisation, instruction processing, and data processing immediate and registers instructions.
    \item Maciej Rytlewski: Single data transfer instructions and bug fixes.
    \item Dina Duong: Branch instructions, bug fixes and report. 
    \item Matty Williams: Suggested code improvements and moved on to Part 2 (Assembler).
\end{itemize}
To coordinate our work, we made a separate branch in the Git Repository, where we experimented with the code. 
After fixing all the errors, we pushed stable working versions to the master branch. 
As the first part is sequential, the initial task was to decide how we want to implement the memory. 
After the discussion, memory initialisation was assigned to Kritik. Once the memory was set up, we all started 
implementing the instructions, dividing the workload equally between the group members. 
After completing the full functionality, Dina and Maciej focused on bug fixing while Kritik and Matty moved on to Part 2.

\subsection*{Group Evaluation}
Overall, our group has been working well together. Since Part 1 involved a sequential implementation of the emulator, 
there were limited opportunities for parallel work. However, the division of tasks among group members helped us progress efficiently.
Regular communication was maintained through discussions, ensuring everyone was aware of the progress and tasks assigned to each member.
\newline
As we progress, we anticipate the need for better task coordination and clearer communication regarding individual responsibilities. 
As the complexity of the project increases, we may need to allocate tasks based on members' expertise and consider potential 
dependencies between different components. Regular progress updates and meetings will be crucial to ensure 
everyone is on the same page and to address any challenges promptly.
