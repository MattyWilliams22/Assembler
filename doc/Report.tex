\section{Assembler Structure and Implementation}

Our assembler is split into five .c files each with their own .h header file.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The first file is assemble.c which contains the main function.
    \item The second file is tokenizer.c which is responsible for parsing the text file given as a parameter and outputting an array of tokenised lines.
    \item The third file is symbolTable.c which contains the functions required to manipulate a symbol table ADT. The symbol table is used to store the address of a label so that the address can be used at the necessary points in the assembly code.
    \item The fourth file is assembleinstructions.c which contains all of the functions responsible for converting operands to their corresponding binary form and combining the binary to form a 32 bit integer.
    \item The fifth file is assemblesetup.c which is responsible for file handling, memory allocation and freeing. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Extension Description and Example of Use}

\subsection{Description}

Our extension is a game of snake. Our code includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Breadth First Search
    \item Random Maze Generation
    \item A* Pathfinding
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example of Use}

\section{Design of Extension and Problems Overcome}

\subsection{Design}

The extension is split up into two .c files and their .h header files.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first file is snake.c which contains the main function and is responsible for the main gameplay loop.
    \item The second file is maze.c which contains the maze generating functions and drawing functions.
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Problems Overcame}

\begin{itemize}
    \item We had problems with displaying the search algorithms properly.
    \item We had problems with memory leaks.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation Testing}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Testsuite
    \item Continuous integration with gitlab
    \item Print messages
    \item GDB
    \item Valgrind
\end{itemize}

As a group we were ... at communicating and splitting work up between the group.
Next time, we would do ... differently. We would keep ... the same.
